# Project

This project is an application developed as part of a job application process. It is designed as kind of fullstack application. Besides the home page of the application which contains static pages and components that provide general information, there is also Book (Bucher) page. The Bucher page allows users to search for books based on their titles and authors. When a user enters the search parameters, the backend PHP communicates with the OpenLibrary API to retrieve matching results.
